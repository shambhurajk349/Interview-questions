# Amazon CloudWatch â€“ Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. What is Amazon CloudWatch?
**Answer:** Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that helps track metrics, logs, and events for AWS resources and applications in real time.  

---

## 2. What is a Metric in CloudWatch?
**Answer:** A metric is a time-ordered set of data points that represents a specific measurement of a resource or application.  
Example: CPUUtilization, NetworkIn, DiskReadOps.  

---

## 3. What is an Alarm in CloudWatch?
**Answer:** An alarm watches a metric and performs actions when the metric reaches a threshold.  
Example: Send an SNS notification when CPU > 80% for 5 minutes.  

---

## 4. What is APM (Application Performance Monitoring)?
**Answer:** APM in CloudWatch monitors application performance and availability by tracking requests, errors, latency, and dependencies.  
It is enabled using ServiceLens and AWS X-Ray.  

---

## 5. How does CloudWatch Work?
**Answer:**  
1. AWS resources generate metrics and logs.  
2. CloudWatch collects these in near real-time.  
3. Users create dashboards, set alarms, and trigger actions (scale up/down, send alerts).  

---

## 6. What are the States of a CloudWatch Alarm?
**Answer:**  
- **OK:** Metric is within threshold.  
- **ALARM:** Metric has crossed the threshold.  
- **INSUFFICIENT_DATA:** Not enough data to determine state.  

---

## 7. What are the Alarm Types in CloudWatch?
**Answer:**  
- **Metric Alarm:** Based on a single metric or math expression.  
- **Composite Alarm:** Combines multiple alarms into one.  

---

## 8. What is Action Status in Alarms?
**Answer:** Alarm actions define what happens when the alarm state changes. Actions include:  
- Sending SNS notifications.  
- Triggering Auto Scaling policies.  
- Stopping, terminating, rebooting, or recovering an EC2 instance.  

---

## 9. What is the Default Period in CloudWatch?
**Answer:** The default metric period is **5 minutes**.  
With high-resolution metrics, you can set periods as low as **1 second**.  

---

## 10. What is an SNS Notification in CloudWatch?
**Answer:** SNS (Simple Notification Service) is used to send alerts when an alarm state changes.  
Notifications can be delivered via email, SMS, or trigger a Lambda function.  

---

## 11. What are the Features of CloudWatch?
**Answer:**  
- Collects and monitors **metrics, logs, and events**.  
- Provides **dashboards** for visualization.  
- Supports **alarms and notifications**.  
- Allows **custom metrics**.  
- Integrates with AWS services like EC2, RDS, Lambda, EKS.  
- Provides **APM** with ServiceLens and X-Ray.  

---

## 12. What is a Dynamic Policy in Auto Scaling and its Types?
**Answer:** Dynamic scaling policies in Auto Scaling use CloudWatch metrics to automatically adjust capacity.  
Types:  
1. **Target Tracking Scaling:** Keeps a metric at a target value (e.g., CPU at 50%).  
2. **Step Scaling:** Changes capacity in steps based on thresholds.  
3. **Simple Scaling:** Adds or removes a fixed number of instances.  

---

## 13. What are Custom Metrics in CloudWatch?
**Answer:** Custom metrics are user-defined metrics that can be published to CloudWatch using the `PutMetricData` API.  
Example: Number of active users, orders processed per minute.  

---

## 14. What are Metric Types in CloudWatch?
**Answer:**  
- **Standard Metrics:** Provided by AWS services by default.  
- **Custom Metrics:** Created and pushed by users.  
- **High-Resolution Metrics:** Collected at intervals as low as 1 second.  

---

## 15. How is AWS Systems Manager used with CloudWatch?
**Answer:** AWS Systems Manager integrates with CloudWatch to automate operational tasks like patching or remediation.  
It can trigger runbooks when an alarm changes state.  

---

## 16. What are Parameters in Systems Manager (SSM)?
**Answer:** Parameters are key-value pairs stored in the **Parameter Store** of Systems Manager.  
They hold configuration data such as API keys, AMI IDs, or passwords and can be used in CloudWatch automation workflows.

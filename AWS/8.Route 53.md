# Amazon Route 53 and DNS Concepts – Q&A

## 1. What is Amazon Route 53?
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service provided by AWS.  
It is mainly used for domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking of resources.

---

## 2. What is the main function of Route 53?
The main function of Route 53 are:

### 1. Domain Registration
- Route 53 lets you register a domain name (like `example.com`).
- This gives your website or application a unique name.

### 2. DNS Routing
- Connects users’ browsers to your website or application.
- Routes internet traffic when someone types your domain/subdomain.
- Example: typing `example.com` → Route 53 connects it to your server.

### 3. Health Checking
- Monitors your resources (like web servers).
- Checks if they are reachable and working.
- Can send alerts and automatically reroute traffic if a server is unhealthy.

## 3. What is an Alias Record in Route 53?
An alias record is a special type of DNS record in Route 53 that maps a domain name to AWS resources such as **CloudFront distributions, S3 buckets, Elastic Load Balancers**, or another Route 53 record in the same hosted zone.  
Unlike CNAME, alias records are free and can be used at the **root domain**.

## 4. What is an Authoritative Name Server?
An authoritative name server is a DNS server that has the original and final copy of DNS records for a domain.  
It provides answers to DNS queries with the actual resource records, instead of forwarding the request.

---

## 5. What is a DNS Resolver?
A DNS resolver is a server (usually run by an ISP or a public DNS provider like Google DNS `8.8.8.8`) that receives a user’s DNS query and finds the correct IP address by contacting authoritative name servers.

---

## 6. What is DNS?
DNS (Domain Name System) is the system that translates **human-readable domain names** (like www.amazon.com) into **machine-readable IP addresses** (like 192.0.2.44).

---

## 7. What is a Hosted Zone in Route 53?
A hosted zone is a container for DNS records for a specific domain.  
- **Public hosted zone** – routes internet traffic to resources.  
- **Private hosted zone** – routes traffic within a VPC.

---

## 8. What is an IP Address?
An IP address is a unique number assigned to every device on a network to identify and communicate with each other.

## 9. Difference between IPv4 and IPv6
| Feature          | IPv4                             | IPv6                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Address Length   | 32-bit (e.g., 192.168.1.1)       | 128-bit (e.g., 2001:db8::1)   |
| Address Space    | ~4.3 billion addresses           | Virtually unlimited           |
| Format           | Dotted decimal notation          | Hexadecimal notation          |
| Example          | 192.0.2.1                        | 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334|

## 10. What is a DNS Record?
A DNS record is an entry in the DNS database that maps a domain to specific resources.  
Examples: **A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, SRV**.

---

## 11. What is a Routing Policy in Route 53?
A routing policy defines **how Route 53 responds to DNS queries**.  
Types include:  
- Simple Routing  
- Weighted Routing  
- Latency-based Routing  
- Failover Routing  
- Geolocation Routing  
- Geoproximity Routing  
- Multivalue Answer Routing

---

## 12. What is a Subdomain?
A subdomain is a part of a larger domain.  
Example: In `blog.example.com`, `blog` is the subdomain of `example.com`.

---

## 13. What is Time to Live (TTL)?
TTL is the amount of time (in seconds) that a DNS record is cached by a DNS resolver before it requests an updated record.  
Example: TTL = 300 → cached for 5 minutes.

---

## 14. What are the Components of Route 53?
- **Domain Registration** – Register and manage domains.  
- **DNS Service** – Translate domain names into IP addresses.  
- **Health Checks & Monitoring** – Monitor resources and route traffic only to healthy endpoints.  
- **Traffic Management (Routing Policies)** – Control how requests are routed globally.

# AWS RDS Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What is RDS?
Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud without managing hardware, software, or backups manually.

---

## 2. Advantages of RDS
- Easy setup, operation, and scaling.
- Automated backups and patching.
- High availability with Multi-AZ deployments.
- Read replicas for performance improvement.
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model.
- Security with encryption and IAM integration.

## 3. What are Database Engines?
Database engines are the underlying software that manages how data is stored, queried, and maintained.  
**Examples supported by RDS:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, Amazon Aurora.

---

## 4. What is DB Instance Storage?
DB Instance Storage is the allocated disk space (in GBs) for your database instance.  
**Types:** General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, Magnetic.

---

## 5. What is NTP Protocol?
NTP (Network Time Protocol) is used by RDS to synchronize the system clock of database instances with accurate time servers.

---

## 6. What is a DB Instance?
A DB Instance is the basic building block of RDS. It is an isolated database environment where you can run multiple databases.

---

## 7. What is a Database?
A Database is an organized collection of data that can be accessed, managed, and updated.

---

## 8. Types of DBMS
- **Relational DBMS (RDBMS):** Stores data in tables with rows and columns (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).  
- **Non-relational DBMS (NoSQL):** Stores data as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-columns (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB).

---

## 9. Relational vs Non-Relational Database
- **Relational DB:** Structured, uses SQL, schema-based, best for transactions.  
- **Non-Relational DB:** Flexible schema, unstructured/semi-structured, best for scalability and big data.

---

## 10. Limitations of RDS
- Limited control over the underlying OS.  
- Max storage size and connection limits.  
- Restricted customization compared to self-managed DBs.  
- Cost may be higher for very large workloads.

---

## 11. Automated Backups vs Snapshots in RDS
- **Automated Backups:** Continuous backups managed by RDS, retained for a set period (1â€“35 days). Automatically deleted after the retention period.  
- **Snapshots:** User-initiated backups, stored until you manually delete them.

---

## 12. What are Read Replicas in RDS?
Read replicas are copies of your primary database that handle **read-only queries**, helping scale read-heavy workloads. They also improve performance without impacting the main DB.

# AWS VPC and Networking Q&A

## 1. What is a Subnet?
A subnet is a smaller network inside a VPC that divides the IP address range to organize and isolate resources.

---

## 2. What are Private IP Ranges?
Private IP ranges are reserved for internal networks and not routable on the internet:  
- 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255  
- 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255  
- 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255  

---

## 3. What is VPC?
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated private network in AWS where you can launch and manage AWS resources securely.

---

## 4. What is CIDR?
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) defines IP address ranges using prefix notation.  
Example: `10.0.0.0/16` → provides 65,536 IPs.

---

## 5. What are Reserved IPs?
In each subnet, 5 IP addresses are reserved by AWS:  
1. Network address  
2. VPC router  
3. DNS server  
4. Future use  
5. Broadcast address  

---

## 6. What is Classful and Classless Addressing?
- **Classful**: Old system dividing IPs into fixed Classes (A, B, C).  
- **Classless**: Uses CIDR, allowing flexible allocation of IP ranges.  

---

## 7. What is an Internet Gateway?
An Internet Gateway (IGW) allows VPC resources to connect to the internet.

---

## 8. What is a Route Table?
A route table is a set of rules that decides how traffic is directed within a VPC (to subnets, internet, NAT, or other networks).

---

## 9. Difference between Default and Custom VPC?
- **Default VPC**: Created automatically by AWS, includes subnets, IGW, and route table by default.  
- **Custom VPC**: Created manually by the user, requires explicit configuration of subnets, gateways, and routes.  

---

## 10. What is a Private Subnet?
A private subnet is a subnet without a direct route to the internet (via IGW). Commonly used for databases and backend services.

---

## 11. What is a NAT Gateway?
A managed service that allows private subnet instances to access the internet securely without exposing them directly.

---

## 12. Difference between Security Group and NACL?
- **Security Group**: Instance-level, stateful (allows return traffic automatically).  
- **NACL (Network ACL)**: Subnet-level, stateless (return traffic must be explicitly allowed).  

---

## 13. What is an Elastic IP?
An Elastic IP is a static public IPv4 address that you can attach to an EC2 instance for consistent internet communication.

---

## 14. What are Peering Connections?
A VPC Peering Connection allows two VPCs to communicate with each other privately as if they were in the same network.

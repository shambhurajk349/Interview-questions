# AWS & Networking Q&A

## 1. What is EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a cloud service by AWS that provides virtual servers (instances) to run applications. You can choose CPU, memory, storage, and network capacity as per your need.

---

## 2. What is SSH?
SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to securely connect to remote servers or computers. It encrypts the communication and is commonly used to log into Linux servers.

---

## 3. What is RDP?
RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is developed by Microsoft. It allows you to connect to and control a Windows machine remotely with a graphical interface.

---

## 4. What is a Web Server?
A web server is software or hardware that serves web pages to users over the internet. Examples: Apache, Nginx, IIS.

---

## 5. What is HTTP and HTTPS?
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for transferring data between a web server and browser. 
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data transfer, ensuring security and privacy.

---

## 6. Difference between Start and Enable (in Linux services) 
- **start** → Immediately starts the service, but it won’t start automatically after reboot.  
- **enable** → Configures the service to automatically start at system boot.  

---

## 7. What is a Firewall?  
A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules. It helps protect systems from unauthorized access.

---

## 8. What is the difference between Static and Dynamic Websites?  
- **Static Website**: Same content for every user, fixed HTML pages.  
- **Dynamic Website**: Content changes based on user request or database (e.g., Amazon, Facebook).  

---

## 9. What are Instance Types in EC2?  
Instance types define the hardware configuration of an EC2 instance (CPU, RAM, storage, networking).  
Example categories: General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized, Accelerated Computing.

---

## 10. What are EC2 Purchasing Options?  
- **On-Demand**: Pay per second, no commitment.  
- **Savings Plans**: Commit spend (1/3 years) for lower cost.  
- **Reserved Instances**: Commit to specific instance type & Region (1/3 years).  
- **Spot Instances**: Use spare capacity at low cost, can be interrupted.  
- **Dedicated Hosts**: Physical server dedicated for you.  
- **Capacity Reservations**: Reserve capacity in a specific AZ.  
- **Per-second billing**: Pay only for seconds used.  

---

## 11. What is an AMI?  
AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a template that contains the software configuration (OS, applications) needed to launch an EC2 instance.

---

## 12. What is EBS?  
EBS (Elastic Block Store) is a block storage service used to store data for EC2 instances. It is persistent storage.

---

## 13. What are Volume Types in EBS?  
- **SSD-backed**: General Purpose SSD (gp3/gp2), Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2/io1).  
- **HDD-backed**: Throughput Optimized HDD (st1), Cold HDD (sc1).  

---

## 14. Difference between SSD and HDD?  
- **SSD (Solid State Drive)**: Faster, more reliable, costlier.  
- **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**: Slower, cheaper, good for large data.  

---

## 15. What is a File System?  
A file system organizes data on a storage device (e.g., ext4, NTFS, FAT32).  

---

## 16. What is Disk Partition?  
Partitioning divides a physical disk into logical parts to manage and organize data.  

---

## 17. What is Temporary and Permanent Mount?  
- **Temporary Mount**: Mount storage manually, lost after reboot.  
- **Permanent Mount**: Defined in `/etc/fstab`, automatically mounted after reboot.  

---

## 18. What is a Snapshot?  
A snapshot is a backup of an EBS volume at a specific point in time.  

---

## 19. What is a Placement Group?  
A placement group is a way to influence how EC2 instances are placed on underlying hardware for performance.  
Types: Cluster, Partition, Spread.  

---

## 20. What is Load Balancing?  
Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve availability and performance.  

---

## 21. What is a Target Group?  
A target group is a group of resources (EC2 instances, IP addresses, Lambda functions) that receive traffic from a load balancer.  

---

## 22. What are the Types of Load Balancers in AWS?  
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)  
- Network Load Balancer (NLB)  
- Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)  
- Classic Load Balancer (CLB)  

---

## 23. What is Path-Based Routing?  
Path-based routing routes traffic based on the URL path (e.g., `/api` goes to API servers, `/images` goes to image servers).  

---

## 24. What is Auto Scaling?  
Auto Scaling automatically increases or decreases the number of EC2 instances based on demand.  

---

## 25. What are the Types of Scaling?  
- **Vertical Scaling**: Change instance size (scale up/down).  
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add or remove instances (scale out/in).  

---

## 26. What is a Template in EC2?  
A Launch Template is a reusable blueprint to launch EC2 instances with predefined settings (AMI, instance type, key pair, security groups, etc.).  

---

## 27. What is an Elastic IP?  
An Elastic IP is a static public IPv4 address that you can associate with an EC2 instance. It remains the same even if the instance is stopped or restarted.
